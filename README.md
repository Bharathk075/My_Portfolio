* Created a question pair similarity validator to detect similar pre-existing questions with the aim to decrease the redundancy of answering questions and optimize the user experience 
* Developed proof of concept for Kaggle competition and explored various NLP techniques-Fuzzy vec, TF-IDF, Glove vectors 
* Created an API using Flask framework and deployed it in Heroku cloud platform. Improved the overall log-loss by 24%. 

# [Project 2: New York City Taxi Demand Prediction](https://github.com/Bharathk075/Newyork-City-Taxi-Demand-Prediction)
* Designed a Taxi Demand prediction system to forecast number of estimated pickups given the location and time in NYC. 
* Developed as a POC based on the data published by Newyork Taxi & Limousine Commission and explored time series analytics aspects using various parallel computing and geospatial visualization libraries: Dask & Folium.  
* Formulated objective function & improved the mean absolute percentage error by 19% using Random Forests, XGBoost, Linear Regression etc.
* Given a location and time, we predict the number of pickups in the next ten minutes to help drivers serve the customers well and make a good living for themselves.
